## The testnet faucet

Since the Shelley Haskell testnet is an independent network, separate from the Cardano mainnet, it requires its own tokens.

The faucet is a web-based service that provides free tokens to users of the testnet who are running a stake pool or other node. The tokens enable users to experiment with Cardano features without spending ada cryptocurrency on the mainnet.

You will need some initial funds to start testing stake pools and delegating stake on the testnet network. The [faucet component](/en/shelley-haskell/tools/faucet/) will provide you with the tokens required to get started.
